11/17/25 - All updated files should now allow the user to search for a movie, add/remove that movie from a personal library that is viewable on their profile page.

11/12/25 - Homepage.html's logo color changed to match the other pages. Profile button was added to the homepage banner once the user is logged in and the button redirects the user to Profile.php. MUST HAVE Profile.php in your folder with the other files.
